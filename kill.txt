Bro, if you were a DBZ charachter, you would be Yamcha
Where's your homework? Cause you guys just got schooled.
Are you Neymar? Because I see you more often on the floor lying down than playing
I can't even call you an animal, these have a survival instinct at least
I would call you a walking ward, but even wards live longer
Cry me a river and put a ward in it
If I had a dollar each time you died, I could buy you another champ
Anyone has a good tutorial on how to change bots difficulty?
Maybe just stick to wildrift bro
How did this guy get passed the login screen?
Do you mind leaving the game? I would rather play with the AI.
