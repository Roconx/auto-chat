I wish you step on a lego after this game
My adc thinks he is playing angry bird and throw hiself into our enemies
I hope every time you go to get bread it is all just the end slices of bread
How are we going to save the planet if my supports can't even save me
The scuttle crab applies more jungle pressure than my jungler
It's not my fault, botlane started with a Doran's Spoon and fed the shit out of Ezreal
Not even Noah's Ark can carry these animals
You would need a gank when laning against a minion
Your grandma makes cookies really really bad
My team is so bad they can't even win a surrender vote
