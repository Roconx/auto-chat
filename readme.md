When the program detects either a kill or death, it performs a certain action.
The current actiions that can be performed are:
- Writing a message in /all chat
- Showing mastery
- Starting a surrender vote

## Usage

To use it, you only need to clone the repository and type 'cargo run' in the terminal, the program should detect the game as soon as loading screen ends.
You can edit the "you_killed.txt" and "you_died.txt" with phrases to your liking.
